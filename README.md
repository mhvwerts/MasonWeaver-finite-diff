# MasonWeaver-finite-diff: Finite-difference solver for the Mason-Weaver equation.

The Mason-Weaver equation describes the sedimentation of Brownian particles (*e.g.* nanoparticles in a liquid). It models sedimentation in the presence of diffusion. The Mason-Weaver
equation is a partial differential equation describing the time-evolution of
the particle concentration profile.

Here, we provide a finite-difference solver for the Mason-Weaver problem. It can be used in the modeling of nanoparticle sedimentation behaviour.

The present solver is based on the Crank-Nicolson finite-difference scheme
described in [1]. That paper contains further explanations of nanoparticle sedimentation.

## Installation and usage

There is no specific installation. The program will run on Python 3 and depends on ``numpy`` and ``scipy``. It is actually a Python module from which the object class ``MWsoln`` can be imported. When creating an instance of this class, a finite-difference solution is immediately calculated (using the supplied parameters) and stored in an array that is accessible as a property of the class.

Inside the module, there is example code that demonstrates how to run ('instantiate') the solver and extract the results.


## New!

We now include a notebook with an example comparing the present finite-difference solver to the [Fipy](https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/) finite-volume solver, demonstrating that both solvers give very similar time-evolution of the concentration profile.
